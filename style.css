  Unfortunately WordPress will require a style.css file
  located in the theme's root folder for stuff to work.

  However, This theme does not use vanilla CSS. It uses Sass

  Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features
  such as variables, nested selectors and loops. It's also
  the easiest way to customize Foundation.

  All Sass files are located in the /scss folder.

  Please read the README.md file before getting started.
  More info on how to use Sass with Foundation can be found here:
  http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html

  Plain CSS added to this file will not propagate unless this file is
  enqueued using the appropriate WordPress hooks.
